# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is built using Next.js, a React framework that provides several advantages over traditional React applications:

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)**: Next.js supports SSR out of the box, which enhances SEO and provides faster initial page loads by rendering pages on the server.
  
- **Automatic code splitting**: Next.js automatically splits code bundles, ensuring that only necessary JavaScript is loaded, optimizing performance.

- **File-based routing**: Next.js uses a file-based routing system, making it intuitive to create and organize routes within the `pages` directory.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Chosen for its SSR capabilities and simplified routing compared to React.js.
  
- **Sass**: Used for styling due to its advanced features like variables and nesting, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

- **IndexedDB**: Utilized for storing user details and authentication data locally, ensuring data persistence and offline access.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Folder Structure

The project follows a structured organization:

- **`components/ui`**: Contains reusable UI components used across the application.

- **`utils/component`**: Houses IndexedDB for storing user authentication and details.

- **`protectedRoute` and `authContext` files**: Implements authentication mechanisms to secure routes and manage user sessions.

- **`pages/page.tsx`**: The main entry point (`dashboard`), displaying the core content of the application.

- **`dashboard/layout`**: Provides a layout structure for the dashboard content.

### Authentication Flow

1. **Signup**: Users must register to access the application.

2. **Sign In**: After signup, users log in to authenticate themselves.

3. **Dashboard**: Upon successful authentication, users are directed to the dashboard where they can access application features.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure to explore the `components/ui` folder for reusable components and `utils/components` for IndexedDB integration details.

- Authentication and route protection are managed through `protectedRoute` and `authContext`, ensuring a secure user experience.

## Deployment

For deployment, consider using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) (recommended for Next.js projects) for seamless deployments and scaling.
